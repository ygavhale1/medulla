                        	<p>Most of the food we eat is turned into glucose (sugar) for our bodies to use for energy. The Pancreas, an organ near the stomach makes a hormone called insulin to help glucose get into our body cells. When you have diabetes, your body either doesn’t make enough insulin or can’t use its own insulin very well. This problem causes glucose to build up in your blood. It is important to remember that diabetes cannot be cured but is controllable to a large extent and at Diabetes - Sweet and Simple; we help you simplify all that’s diabetes.</p>

                       		<p><strong>Type1 Diabetes Mellitus:</strong> In people with Type1 diabetes or insulin dependent diabetes, the body does not make sufficient or any insulin to meet the needs of the body. It is most often diagnosed in children and adolescents. Therefore, people with Type 1 diabetes need to take insulin every day.</p>
                            <p><strong>Type2 Diabetes Mellitus: </strong>Type2 diabetes, also called non-insulin dependent diabetes is the most common type. In people with type 2 diabetes, either the person is not making enough insulin, or the body is resistant to insulin and cannot use it properly. This type of diabetes is more common in adults and older people. It can be managed through a combination of oral medication, and/or insulin, diet and exercise.</p>
                            <p><strong>Gestational Diabetes Mellitus: </strong>This type of diabetes is seen in pregnant women. If diabetes is not properly managed at the right time, it can lead to complications. Hence, in this type of diabetes there is a need to be extremely cautious about blood glucose levels.</p>
                            <p>Please remember, controlling each of these types of diabetes requires different steps. Ask your doctor for more information.</p>

                        	<p>Diabetes often goes undetected early because the early signs and symptoms that occur are vague and indistinct. Diabetes can be confirmed only after a lab test. However, here are some signs and symptoms that are associated with high blood glucose levels:</p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>Being very thirsty and urinating a lot</li>
                              <li>Having blurry vision</li>
                              <li>Feeling very tired most of the time</li>
                              <li>Unexpected weight loss</li>
                              <li>Having very dry skin and sores that are slow  to heal</li>
                              <li>Getting more infections than usual</li>
                              <li>Loss of sensation or tingling feeling in the  feet</li>
                              <li>Vomiting</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>If you have one or more of these diabetes symptoms, see your doctor right away. The doctor will ask you to get a blood test done to check your blood glucose levels, the most reliable way to know if you have diabetes. </p>

                        	<p>Insulin is a hormone (chemical substance), made by the pancreas, an organ situated near the stomach.  The pancreas release insulin into the blood, which helps the glucose that comes from the food to enter the cells in your body. If the pancreas do not make enough insulin or if your body is resistant to the insulin produced, then the glucose cannot get into your cells. So, insulin stays in your blood and increases your blood glucose levels causing diabetes.</p>

                        	<p>Unfortunately, once diagnosed with diabetes, it is not curable. Diabetes may be kept under tight control with proper choice of foods that do not raise blood glucose, along with exercise, medication and/or insulin. In type1 diabetes, the cells of the pancreas that produce insulin are destroyed. Once the cells are destroyed, they will never make insulin again, so people with type1 diabetes will always need to take insulin. Type2 diabetes is reversible at a stage, when an individual is identified to be at risk of acquiring diabetes. Ask your doctor for more information on this topic.</p>

                        	<p>Family history plays a significant part in susceptibility to diabetes because of the genes being passed from biological parent to the child. But, just because your father and/or mother have diabetes doesn't mean that you will develop diabetes. Apart from heredity there are other risk factors such as being overweight or obese, physically inactive, history of high blood pressure and cholesterol, history of diabetes during pregnancy (gestational diabetes) etc. also increase your risk of developing  diabetes.</p>
                            <p>Fortunately, the risk of type2 diabetes can be reduced by watching their weight, eating healthy food and being physically active / exercising. It is also important to have regular check-ups with your doctor.

                        	<p>Diabetes is a lifelong condition that may lead to other health complications. Research studies indicate that type1 diabetes cannot be prevented. But the good news is that if you are at risk of developing diabetes, you can take steps to prevent type2 diabetes. Maintaining healthy weight, being physically active and eating healthy foods can help to lower your chances of getting diabetes (type2). It is also important to have regular tests done to know your blood glucose levels based on your doctor’s recommendation.</p>

                            <p>Healthy eating for people with diabetes includes:</p>
                            <ul>

                            <p>This is an approach, which would be endorsed by most dieticians. You should have your own meal plan. Ask your doctor to give you the name of a dietician who can work with you to develop a meal plan. Adding a no calorie sweetener such as Splenda to your diet plan helps ensure that you limit your sugar but do not sacrifice the "sweetness", - so controlling your diabetes stays sweet and simple.</p>

                            	<li><strong>Carbohydrates</strong> should provide 45 - 65% of total daily calories. The type and amount of carbohydrate are both important. Best choices are vegetables, fruits, beans, and whole grains. These foods are also high in fibre. </li>
                                <li><strong>Fats</strong> should provide 25 - 35% of daily calories. Monounsaturated (such as olive oil and nuts) and omega-3 polyunsaturated (such as fish and walnuts) fats are the best types. Limit saturated fat (red meat, butter) to less than 7% of daily calories. </li>
                                <li><strong>Protein</strong> should provide 12 - 20% of daily calories, although this may vary depending on an individual’s health requirement. Fish, soy, and poultry are better protein choices than red meat.</li>

Foods that contain carbohydrate also tend to contain a lot of other healthy nutrients. Today, most people with diabetes are encouraged to eat a balanced diet containing; grains, vegetables, fruits, meat and dairy products.</p>
                            <p>The key to keeping blood glucose levels at your goal, is to balance the food you eat with your physical activity and any pills or insulin you take. Consider making an appointment with a registered dietician or your doctor, who can review your individual needs and circumstances and help you tailor a nutritional diet plan that’s right for you.</p>

                              <li><strong>Helps to maintains more consistent blood sugar  levels:</strong>When people with  diabetes eat six meals at regular intervals throughout the day, blood sugar  does not have time to drop to any significant degree.</li>
                              <li><strong>Reduces the urge to binge: </strong>Frequent meals, decrease your risk of over eating.</li>
                              <li><strong>Promotes hydration: Most people accompany their  meal with a drink like water,</strong> this  promotes better hydration.</li>
                              <li><strong>Decreases hunger sensation:</strong> Especially in those who are reducing calorie  intake to promote weight loss. Also improves the body’s metabolism. </li>

                        <div class="detail" style="display: none;">
                        	<p>For people with diabetes, snacks between meals helps to keep blood sugar levels stable and sustain high energy through the day. When it comes to snacking, people often think of foods that are high in sugar, salt and fat, but you have lots of other options. Instead of buying fried and unhealthy snacks, you can plan ahead and pack a healthy snack from home. Choose foods like whole grain biscuits, sprouts, nuts or cereal mix made with roasted oats. Keep plenty of fresh fruits, vegetable salad and sandwiches made of whole wheat bread in your fridge that is ready to grab and go. </p>

                        	<p>For people with diabetes, artificial sweeteners may be a good alternative to sugar. However, there are several sugar substitutes available and it is important to choose one that:</p>
                            <ol>
                              <li>Tastes  like sugar so you do not have to sacrifice the taste <strong> </strong></li>

                        	<p>A no calorie sweetener such as Splenda from Johnson &amp; Johnson is a sugar substitute that fulfils all these criteria and is a healthy choice for people with diabetes or people looking to lose weight.</p>

                        	<p>Here are some ways that alcohol can affect your diabetes:</p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>While moderate  amounts of alcohol can cause blood sugar to rise, excess alcohol can actually  cause your blood sugar levels to fall.</li>
                              <li>Beer and  Wine contain carbohydrates and may raise your blood sugar. </li>
                              <li>Alcohol  stimulates your appetite, which can cause you to overeat and may affect your  blood sugar control. </li>
                              <li>Alcohol can  interfere with the positive effects of oral diabetes medicines or insulin. </li>
                              <li>Alcohol may  increase triglyceride levels and blood pressure.</li>

                            <p>For these reasons, alcohol is best avoided for people with diabetes. If you’re going to drink, do so in moderation. Choose calorie-free drink mixers, and drink only with food, preferably with high-fibre snacks like raw carrots.</p>

                        	<p>It is a common myth that if you have diabetes you shouldn't eat fruits because they are sweet. Fruits are a great source for anti-oxidants and other micronutrients, which is good for health, especially for people with diabetes. Fruits that are particularly good for people with diabetes include citrus fruits like oranges and sweet limes (mausambis); berries like strawberries; and apples. Fruits that Indians typically love but should be consumed carefully are grapes and mangoes, especially for people with diabetes.

                              <li><strong>Chromium</strong> may help control blood glucose levels and aid weight loss.</li>

                        	<p>For controlling blood glucose, walking is the best exercise for elderly people with diabetes, especially for those who can’t workout at the gym. Elderly people who are identified as the highest risk for falls seem to benefit from regular exercise. Ideally, an exercise program of balance, strength, flexibility, and walking are shown to reduce the risk of diabetes related complications. However, some people who have a chronic disease, such as a heart condition, arthritis, or high blood pressure etc. should plan their exercise program under the care of a doctor and talk to him/her about the types of physical activity that are appropriate for their health. </p>

                              <li>Wear good, protective footwear to help avoid injuries and wounds to the feet.</li>

                              <li>If your blood glucose level is below 100, it is advisable to have a snack before exercise.</li>
                              <li>&nbsp;Drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration, as it can raise your blood glucose. Before exercising, avoid alcohol and certain medication which increase the risk of very low blood       glucose.</li>

If your blood glucose is below 70 mg/dl, follow the “Rule of 15”immediately. It means consume about 15 grams of carbohydrate (1- 2 teaspoons of sugar or honey or ½ cup of fruit juice).  Wait for 15 minutes and check your blood glucose levels again. If it is still below 70 take another 15 grams of carbohydrates. If your blood glucose is not below 70mg/dL but it is over an hour for the next meal, have a small snack like a cracker, a small sandwich or half a cup of milk.</p>

                        	<p>Before getting a test done for diagnosing diabetes, your doctor will take your medical history, including information about the symptoms, risk factors for diabetes, past and present medical problems, current medications, allergies to medications, family history of diabetes, personal habits and lifestyle. A number of laboratory tests are available to confirm the diagnosis of diabetes. Talk to you doctor, he/she will examine your health condition and recommend you the kinds of tests you need to get done. You can get it done either at the laboratory or at your doctor’s clinic/hospital. </p>

                        	<p>Tracking your diabetes is the first step to managing and controlling your condition. This day-in and day-out responsibility is largely up to you, so that you can lead a healthy life.</p>
                            <p>For a person with diabetes, it is important to track the following:</p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>Blood glucose </li>

                              <li>Blood pressure</li>
                              <li>Blood lipid content (cholesterol)</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The most important aspect of diabetes that needs to be tracked is your blood glucose level. Keeping your blood glucose at or near normal can help prevent or delay serious complications such as eye problems, kidney disease and nerve damage.A blood glucose meter brand such as OneTouch has a range of products that can help you track your blood glucose levels.</p>

                        	<p>Everyone’s blood has some glucose in it. Blood glucose goes up after eating, but 1 or 2 hours later returns to the normal range. According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), blood glucose targets for most people with diabetes before a meal should be between 70 to 130 mg/dL and one to two hours after the start of the meal should be below 180 mg/dL. Ask your doctor about your personal blood glucose target. A blood glucose meter brand such as OneTouch provides range of meters to meet your needs.</p>

                        	<p>HbA1C (Glycated haemoglobin) is your estimated “average blood glucose”. The more glucose is found in the blood the more glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) will be present. This blood test is done at the laboratory or in your Doctor’s clinic every 3 to 6 months. It measures the average amount of blood glucose that has been in your blood over the last 3 months. ‘A1c’ tells your average blood glucose over the past 14 days. Both ‘day to day self-monitoring’ and ‘periodic A1C monitoring’ are necessary to keep careful track of your blood glucose control. Your estimated average glucose is strongly linked to your risk of developing long-term complications of diabetes. The closer your average is to normal levels of 6.5% or below, the better for your health.</p>

                        	<p>Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is an important aspect of modern diabetes management. SMBG has been recommended for people with diabetes in order to help achieve a specific level of blood glucose control. Many people use an electronic meter (glucose meter), a small portable device which accurately measures glucose concentrations in a finger prick blood sample.</p>
                            <p>Blood glucose is best measured at different times in the day to show levels of blood glucose.  The frequency of self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) varies from person to person.   Blood glucose is most commonly checked before and after meals, before and after exercise or before bed. Ask your doctor for more information on self-monitoring of blood glucose and how often you should check your blood glucose.To know the procedure for self-monitoring of blood glucose, click on this useful link <a class="fancyPop" href="https://jnj.vizualize.com/Spenda/Tabs/FAQs/php/popup.php?url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/blood-sugar/DA00007" target="_blank">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/blood-sugar/DA00007</a></p>

                        	<p>High blood glucose also known as hyperglycaemia is a condition caused when you don’t have enough insulin in your body. If your blood glucose level is above 180 mg/dL then your blood glucose is above the target range. It can happen if you forget taking your diabetes medicines, eat too much, or don’t get enough exercise. Sometimes, the medicines you take for other problems may cause high blood glucose.</p>
                            <p>If you’re very thirsty and tired, have blurry vision, and have to go to the bathroom often, then your blood glucose may be too high. Very high blood glucose may also make you feel sick in the stomach. If your blood glucose is high most of the time, call or visit your doctor at the earliest. You may need to make changes to your diabetes medicines and your life-style.</p>

                        	<p>Low blood glucose, also called hypoglycaemia happens if your blood glucose drops too low. If your blood glucose level is below 70 mg/dl then your blood glucose is below the target range. Hypoglycaemia can be caused by overdose of diabetes medicine, missing / delaying a meal, exercising more than usual, or excessive consumption of alcoholic beverages. Sometimes, the medicines you take for other health problems can also cause blood glucose to drop. Low blood glucose can make you feel weak, confused, irritable, hungry, or tired.</p>
                            <p>If you feel that your blood glucose levels are dropping, confirm by checking your blood glucose levels right away. If it is below 70 mg/dl follow the”Rule of 15”. That is, take 15 grams of carbohydrate (1-2 teaspoons of sugar or honey or ½ cup of fruit juice)-wait for 15 minutes and check again.  If still low, repeat the carbohydrate dose and wait for15 minutes, and check to see if the blood glucose is back to normal range.</p>

                        	<p>One of the major complications of diabetes is cardiovascular disease (related to the heart and blood vessels), which can lead to heart attack and stroke. It also causes poor blood circulation in the legs and feet. To check for cardiovascular disease, you will need to get a blood test done to see how much cholesterol is in your blood (at least once a year), and get your blood glucose and pressure checked at every visit to the doctor. Your doctor may also check the circulation in your legs, feet, and neck.</p>
                            <p>The best way to prevent cardiovascular disease is to take good care of yourself and your diabetes. Eat food that is low in sodium and saturated fats. Keep your blood glucose, blood pressure and bad cholesterol (LDL-Low Density Lipoprotein) within the target ranges.</p>

                            <p><strong>Cataracts: </strong>It causes clouding of the  eye’s natural lens, thereby causing obstruction of external light from entering  the eye, thus impairing the vision.<br>
                     			 <strong>Glaucoma: </strong>It occurs when pressure  builds up in the eye. <br>
                      				<strong>Retinopathy: </strong>Diabetic  retinopathy is a general term for all disorders of the retina caused by  diabetes.</p>
                            <p>Hence it’s vital for people with diabetes to keep their blood glucose within the target ranges. If you have diabetes, regular visits to your eye doctor for eye check-ups are important to avoid such problems.</p>

                        	<p>Foot problems are one of the common complications seen in people with diabetes. It is caused by prolonged high glucose levels, leading to the damage of the nervous system or/and to the blood vessels. This can eventually lead to breakdown of the skin of the foot and sores may develop. Identification of the risk factors in the initial stages is effective for the prevention of these foot problems damage that can result in loss of protective sensation in the feet, poor circulation, and poor healing of foot ulcers. All individuals with diabetes should get regular foot examinations done at the doctor’s clinic.</p>

                        	<p>People with diabetes may develop nerve damage throughout the body called diabetic neuropathy. It appears to be more common in people who have problems controlling their blood glucose and those with high levels of blood fat and blood pressure.</p>
                            <p>Different  types of diabetic neuropathy are as following; Peripheral<strong> neuropathy,</strong> the most common  type t causes pain or loss of feeling in the toes, feet, legs, hands, and arms.<strong> Autonomic neuropathy</strong> causes changes in  digestion, bowel and bladder function, sexual response, and perspiration.<strong> Proximal neuropathy</strong> causes pain in the  thighs, hips, or buttocks and leads to weakness in the legs.<strong> Focal neuropathy</strong> results in the sudden  weakness of one nerve or a group of nerves, causing muscle weakness or pain. </p>

                        	<p>Both men and women with diabetes can develop sexual problems because of the damage to nerves and small blood vessels. This damage can hinder normal functioning of genitals, contributing to sexual dysfunction. Men may have difficulty with erections or ejaculation. Women may have problems with sexual response and vaginal lubrication. People who keep their diabetes under control can lower their risk of early onset of these sexual problems.</p>
