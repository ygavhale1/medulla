                        	<p>The diet recommended for people with diabetes is a healthy diet for everyone. So, you are not required to buy special foods. Healthy diet is synonymous with healthy eating.</p>
                            <p>Healthy eating for people with diabetes includes:</p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>Limiting foods that are high in sugar and salt. </li>

                              <li>Being careful about when and how many carbohydrates  you eat. </li>
                              <li>Eating a variety of whole-grain foods, fruits and  vegetables every day. </li>
                              <li>Eating less  fat and limiting your use of alcohol.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>This is an approach, which would be endorsed by most dieticians. You should have your own meal plan. Ask your doctor to give you the name of a dietician who can work with you to develop a meal plan. Adding a no calorie sweetener such as Splenda to your diet plan helps ensure that you limit your sugar but do not sacrifice the "sweetness", - so controlling your diabetes stays sweet and simple.</p>

                        	<p>Several good dietary methods are available to meet the diet and nutritional goals of people with diabetes. General dietary guidelines recommended are: </p>
                            <ul>
                            	<li><strong>Carbohydrates</strong> should provide 45 - 65% of total daily calories. The type and amount of carbohydrate are both important. Best choices are vegetables, fruits, beans, and whole grains. These foods are also high in fibre. </li>
                                <li><strong>Fats</strong> should provide 25 - 35% of daily calories. Monounsaturated (such as olive oil and nuts) and omega-3 polyunsaturated (such as fish and walnuts) fats are the best types. Limit saturated fat (red meat, butter) to less than 7% of daily calories. </li>
                                <li><strong>Protein</strong> should provide 12 - 20% of daily calories, although this may vary depending on an individual’s health requirement. Fish, soy, and poultry are better protein choices than red meat.</li>

                        	<p>The carbohydrate in food makes blood glucose levels go up, but that does not mean that people with diabetes should avoid carbohydrates completely. Foods that contain carbohydrate also tend to contain a lot of other healthy nutrients. Today, most people with diabetes are encouraged to eat a balanced diet containing; grains, vegetables, fruits, meat and dairy products.</p>
                            <p>The key to keeping blood glucose levels at your goal, is to balance the food you eat with your physical activity and any pills or insulin you take. Consider making an appointment with a registered dietician or your doctor, who can review your individual needs and circumstances and help you tailor a nutritional diet plan that’s right for you.</p>

                        	<p>The concept of six small meals a day for people with diabetes has been supported by the American Diabetes Association. Some of the reasons for people with diabetes to eat at regular intervals are listed below: </p>
                            <ul>
                              <li><strong>Helps to maintains more consistent blood sugar  levels:</strong>When people with  diabetes eat six meals at regular intervals throughout the day, blood sugar  does not have time to drop to any significant degree.</li>
                              <li><strong>Reduces the urge to binge: </strong>Frequent meals, decrease your risk of over eating.</li>
                              <li><strong>Promotes hydration: Most people accompany their  meal with a drink like water,</strong> this  promotes better hydration.</li>
                              <li><strong>Decreases hunger sensation:</strong> Especially in those who are reducing calorie  intake to promote weight loss. Also improves the body’s metabolism. </li>

                        	<p>For people with diabetes, snacks between meals helps to keep blood sugar levels stable and sustain high energy through the day. When it comes to snacking, people often think of foods that are high in sugar, salt and fat, but you have lots of other options. Instead of buying fried and unhealthy snacks, you can plan ahead and pack a healthy snack from home. Choose foods like whole grain biscuits, sprouts, nuts or cereal mix made with roasted oats. Keep plenty of fresh fruits, vegetable salad and sandwiches made of whole wheat bread in your fridge that is ready to grab and go. </p>

                              <li>Beer and  Wine contain carbohydrates and may raise your blood sugar. </li>
                              <li>Alcohol  stimulates your appetite, which can cause you to overeat and may affect your  blood sugar control. </li>

                        	<p>It is a common myth that if you have diabetes you shouldn't eat fruits because they are sweet. Fruits are a great source for anti-oxidants and other micronutrients, which is good for health, especially for people with diabetes. Fruits that are particularly good for people with diabetes include citrus fruits like oranges and sweet limes (mausambis); berries like strawberries; and apples. Fruits that Indians typically love but should be consumed carefully are grapes and mangoes, especially for people with diabetes.

                              <li><strong>Chromium</strong> may help control blood glucose levels and aid weight loss.</li>

Ideally, an exercise program of balance, strength, flexibility, and walking are shown to reduce the risk of diabetes related complications. However, some people who have a chronic disease, such as a heart condition, arthritis, or high blood pressure etc. should plan their exercise program under the care of a doctor and talk to him/her about the types of physical activity that are appropriate for their health. </p>

                              <li>Wear good, protective footwear to help avoid injuries and wounds to the feet.</li>

Wait for 15 minutes and check your blood glucose levels again. If it is still below 70 take another 15 grams of carbohydrates. If your blood glucose is not below 70mg/dL but it is over an hour for the next meal, have a small snack like a cracker, a small sandwich or half a cup of milk.</p>

                        	<p>Before getting a test done for diagnosing diabetes, your doctor will take your medical history, including information about the symptoms, risk factors for diabetes, past and present medical problems, current medications, allergies to medications, family history of diabetes, personal habits and lifestyle. A number of laboratory tests are available to confirm the diagnosis of diabetes. Talk to you doctor, he/she will examine your health condition and recommend you the kinds of tests you need to get done. You can get it done either at the laboratory or at your doctor’s clinic/hospital. </p>

                        	<p>Tracking your diabetes is the first step to managing and controlling your condition. This day-in and day-out responsibility is largely up to you, so that you can lead a healthy life.</p>
                            <p>For a person with diabetes, it is important to track the following:</p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>Blood glucose </li>

                              <li>Blood pressure</li>
                              <li>Blood lipid content (cholesterol)</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The most important aspect of diabetes that needs to be tracked is your blood glucose level. Keeping your blood glucose at or near normal can help prevent or delay serious complications such as eye problems, kidney disease and nerve damage.A blood glucose meter brand such as OneTouch has a range of products that can help you track your blood glucose levels.</p>

                        	<p>Everyone’s blood has some glucose in it. Blood glucose goes up after eating, but 1 or 2 hours later returns to the normal range. According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), blood glucose targets for most people with diabetes before a meal should be between 70 to 130 mg/dL and one to two hours after the start of the meal should be below 180 mg/dL. Ask your doctor about your personal blood glucose target. A blood glucose meter brand such as OneTouch provides range of meters to meet your needs.</p>

                        	<p>HbA1C (Glycated haemoglobin) is your estimated “average blood glucose”. The more glucose is found in the blood the more glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) will be present. This blood test is done at the laboratory or in your Doctor’s clinic every 3 to 6 months. It measures the average amount of blood glucose that has been in your blood over the last 3 months. ‘A1c’ tells your average blood glucose over the past 14 days. Both ‘day to day self-monitoring’ and ‘periodic A1C monitoring’ are necessary to keep careful track of your blood glucose control. Your estimated average glucose is strongly linked to your risk of developing long-term complications of diabetes. The closer your average is to normal levels of 6.5% or below, the better for your health.</p>

                        	<p>Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is an important aspect of modern diabetes management. SMBG has been recommended for people with diabetes in order to help achieve a specific level of blood glucose control. Many people use an electronic meter (glucose meter), a small portable device which accurately measures glucose concentrations in a finger prick blood sample.</p>
                            <p>Blood glucose is best measured at different times in the day to show levels of blood glucose.  The frequency of self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) varies from person to person.   Blood glucose is most commonly checked before and after meals, before and after exercise or before bed. Ask your doctor for more information on self-monitoring of blood glucose and how often you should check your blood glucose.To know the procedure for self-monitoring of blood glucose, click on this useful link <a class="fancyPop" href="https://jnj.vizualize.com/Spenda/Tabs/FAQs/php/popup.php?url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/blood-sugar/DA00007" target="_blank">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/blood-sugar/DA00007</a></p>

                        	<p>High blood glucose also known as hyperglycaemia is a condition caused when you don’t have enough insulin in your body. If your blood glucose level is above 180 mg/dL then your blood glucose is above the target range. It can happen if you forget taking your diabetes medicines, eat too much, or don’t get enough exercise. Sometimes, the medicines you take for other problems may cause high blood glucose.</p>
                            <p>If you’re very thirsty and tired, have blurry vision, and have to go to the bathroom often, then your blood glucose may be too high. Very high blood glucose may also make you feel sick in the stomach. If your blood glucose is high most of the time, call or visit your doctor at the earliest. You may need to make changes to your diabetes medicines and your life-style.</p>

                        	<p>Low blood glucose, also called hypoglycaemia happens if your blood glucose drops too low. If your blood glucose level is below 70 mg/dl then your blood glucose is below the target range. Hypoglycaemia can be caused by overdose of diabetes medicine, missing / delaying a meal, exercising more than usual, or excessive consumption of alcoholic beverages. Sometimes, the medicines you take for other health problems can also cause blood glucose to drop. Low blood glucose can make you feel weak, confused, irritable, hungry, or tired.</p>
                            <p>If you feel that your blood glucose levels are dropping, confirm by checking your blood glucose levels right away. If it is below 70 mg/dl follow the”Rule of 15”. That is, take 15 grams of carbohydrate (1-2 teaspoons of sugar or honey or ½ cup of fruit juice)-wait for 15 minutes and check again.  If still low, repeat the carbohydrate dose and wait for15 minutes, and check to see if the blood glucose is back to normal range.</p>

                        	<p>One of the major complications of diabetes is cardiovascular disease (related to the heart and blood vessels), which can lead to heart attack and stroke. It also causes poor blood circulation in the legs and feet. To check for cardiovascular disease, you will need to get a blood test done to see how much cholesterol is in your blood (at least once a year), and get your blood glucose and pressure checked at every visit to the doctor. Your doctor may also check the circulation in your legs, feet, and neck.</p>
                            <p>The best way to prevent cardiovascular disease is to take good care of yourself and your diabetes. Eat food that is low in sodium and saturated fats. Keep your blood glucose, blood pressure and bad cholesterol (LDL-Low Density Lipoprotein) within the target ranges.</p>

                        	<p>High blood sugar (glucose) increases the risk of diabetes related eye problems. The three major eye diseases that people with diabetes may develop and should be aware of are: </p>
                            <p><strong>Cataracts: </strong>It causes clouding of the  eye’s natural lens, thereby causing obstruction of external light from entering  the eye, thus impairing the vision.<br>
                     			 <strong>Glaucoma: </strong>It occurs when pressure  builds up in the eye. <br>
                      				<strong>Retinopathy: </strong>Diabetic  retinopathy is a general term for all disorders of the retina caused by  diabetes.</p>
                            <p>Hence it’s vital for people with diabetes to keep their blood glucose within the target ranges. If you have diabetes, regular visits to your eye doctor for eye check-ups are important to avoid such problems.</p>

                        	<p>Foot problems are one of the common complications seen in people with diabetes. It is caused by prolonged high glucose levels, leading to the damage of the nervous system or/and to the blood vessels. This can eventually lead to breakdown of the skin of the foot and sores may develop. Identification of the risk factors in the initial stages is effective for the prevention of these foot problems damage that can result in loss of protective sensation in the feet, poor circulation, and poor healing of foot ulcers. All individuals with diabetes should get regular foot examinations done at the doctor’s clinic.</p>

                        	<p>People with diabetes may develop nerve damage throughout the body called diabetic neuropathy. It appears to be more common in people who have problems controlling their blood glucose and those with high levels of blood fat and blood pressure.</p>
                            <p>Different  types of diabetic neuropathy are as following; Peripheral<strong> neuropathy,</strong> the most common  type t causes pain or loss of feeling in the toes, feet, legs, hands, and arms.<strong> Autonomic neuropathy</strong> causes changes in  digestion, bowel and bladder function, sexual response, and perspiration.<strong> Proximal neuropathy</strong> causes pain in the  thighs, hips, or buttocks and leads to weakness in the legs.<strong> Focal neuropathy</strong> results in the sudden  weakness of one nerve or a group of nerves, causing muscle weakness or pain. </p>

                        	<p>Both men and women with diabetes can develop sexual problems because of the damage to nerves and small blood vessels. This damage can hinder normal functioning of genitals, contributing to sexual dysfunction. Men may have difficulty with erections or ejaculation. Women may have problems with sexual response and vaginal lubrication. People who keep their diabetes under control can lower their risk of early onset of these sexual problems.</p>
