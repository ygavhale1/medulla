                                            <p>There is a common misconception that all body fat is bad. But the fact is that some body fat is needed to protect the person’s health as well as supplying a reservoir of energy for performing various body functions.</p>

                                            	<li>Essential fat - is the minimal amount of fat necessary for normal physiological function. For males and females, essential fat values are typically considered to be 3% and 12%, respectively. When minimal recommended levels of essential fat drops, it may negatively affect the delivery of vitamins to the organs, and overall well-being.</li>
                                                <li>Nonessential fat – is above the minimal amount of essential fat. It is generally accepted that a range of 10-22 percent for men and 20-32 percent for women is considered satisfactory for good health. Non-essential body fat above the recommended range increases the risk of developing obesity-related diseases such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and even heart attack. </li>

                                           <p>Dietary guidelines suggest that healthy adults should limit dietary fat to no more than 20 to 35 percent of total daily calories. To understand how many fat grams or calories you can intake, start with the number of calories you normally eat in a day. Multiply that number by the recommended percentages to get the range of fat calories you can eat each day.</p>
                                           <h3>Here's an example based on a 2,000-calorie-a-day diet:</h3>
                                           <p>Multiply 2,000 by .20 (20 percent) to get 400 calories There are 9 calories in a gram of fat, so you divide the number of calories by 9. Divide 400 calories by 9 (calories a gram) to get about 44 grams of fat. So if you're on a 2,000-calorie-a-day diet, 400 can come from dietary fat, which translates to between 44 grams a day. </p>

                                            <p>Metabolism is the process by which your body burns calories from the food you eat and drink into energy. Whether you are eating, drinking, sleeping, working etc. your body is constantly burning calories to keep you going.
Metabolism is affected by body’s composition such as the amount of muscle you have versus the amount of fat. Muscle uses more calories to maintain itself than fat, hence people who are more muscular with lower percentage of body fat are said to have a higher metabolism than others who are less muscular.

                                            <p>Obesity is a condition in which there is excess fat accumulation in the body.  Obesity is commonly measured by body mass index (BMI) which calculates the relationship of weight to height. A person is considered obese if his or her BMI is above 25 according to Indian guidelines and above 30 according to WHO (World Health Organization) guidelines.</p>
                                            <p>Obesity is considered to be a condition that can have adverse effects on one’s health and increases the risk of developing health problems such as heart diseases, type 2 diabetes and more. Weight loss can help in reducing the risk of developing these health problems. </p>

It is also important to note that diet may not always be the cause of weight gain, there could be other influencing factors such as hormonal dysfunction, medications, genetic make-up, and other underlying diseases associated with weight gain.  If you notice a weight gain in spite of a controlled diet and exercise, consult your doctor to diagnose the cause.</p>

After surgery, the stomach may at first hold as little as an ounce, although later that could stretch to 2 or 3 ounces.</li>
												<li><strong>Malabsorptive procedures (alter the digestive process, causing food to be poorly digested and incompletely absorbed):</strong> work by changing how you take in food. In addition to restricting the size of the stomach, these surgeries physically remove or bypass parts of your digestive tract, which makes it harder for your body to absorb calories </li>

Many people are of the opinion that bariatric surgery is a form of cosmetic surgery but the main difference here is that it is designed to improve many obesity related health conditions, such as type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure. On the other hand cosmetic surgery is usually undertaken for reasons of physical enhancement.</p>

                                            <p>Bariatric/weight loss surgery is a procedure that reduces the stomach size, allowing limited food intake or preventing complete absorption of food. This procedure helps you to feel satisfied sooner, but it does not eliminate the desire to eat. Therefore, without regular exercise and a healthy diet, it is unlikely that you will achieve your weight loss goals. Discuss the same with your surgeon or support team and plan out a program that will suit you best.</p>

Weight loss surgery will result in a lowering of your blood pressure and blood sugar levels as well as improving your overall health. Pregnancy does mean weight gain so you will be constantly monitored to see that you don’t put on too much weight.  If you are thinking of starting a family, then discuss this with your surgeon and gynecologist.</p>

                                            <p>Gastric Bypass restricts food intake and the amount of calories and nutrients the body absorbs. In this procedure, the surgeon divides the stomach into a small upper stomach pouch and a larger lower stomach pouch. A section of the small intestine is directly attached to the smaller upper pouch. This allows food to bypass a portion of the small intestine. Having a smaller stomach pouch causes you to feel full sooner and eat less; bypassing part of the small intestine means the body absorbs fewer calories.</p>

During a sleeve gastrectomy procedure, a thin vertical sleeve of the  stomach is created using a stapling device. The rest of the stomach is removed. The sleeve is about the size of a banana. As a result, you’ll feel fuller sooner and stay fuller longer. Sleeve gastrectomy allows for normal digestion and absorption.</p>

Once you have made up your mind to go forward with surgery, a dietician plays an essential role in the success of a bariatric surgery. The dietician assesses monitors and counsels a patient before and after surgery to improve adherence, maximize weight loss, increase motivation and ensure optimum nutrition.

                                            <p>Your doctor is the best person to advice you about your diet post-surgery. You must be prepared for a drastic change of eating habits following your operation. Due to the small size of your new stomach pouch, you will feel full after a very small amount of food. A typical diet after gastric reduction surgery starts with clear liquids only; then broadens gradually to include any liquids, then semi-solids, then a low-fat solid diet. This should become a permanent way of eating if you wish to achieve permanent weight loss.</p>
