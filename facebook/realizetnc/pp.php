familiar with how we collect, use, and disclose information. This Privacy Policy describes our
practices in connection with information that we or our service providers collect through the Web
site or Web property (including, for example, a mobile Web site or application) operated and
controlled by us from which you are accessing this Privacy Policy (each, the “Site”). By providing
personal information to us or by using the Site, you agree to the terms and conditions of this
Privacy Policy.</p>
             <h2>INFORMATION COLLECTION</h2>
             <p>
             <span class="newtext">Information You Provide</span><br />
             Some areas of the Site may ask you to submit personal information in order for you to benefit
from the specified features (such as newsletter subscriptions, tips/pointers, or order processing)
or to participate in a particular activity (such as sweepstakes or other promotions). You will be
informed what information is required and what information is optional.<br />
We may combine the information you submit with other information we have collected from you,
whether on- or offline, including, for example, your purchase history. We may also combine it
with information we receive about you from other sources, such as other Johnson & Johnson
Operating Companies, publicly available information sources (including information from your
publicly available social media profiles), and other third parties.</p>
               <p>
               <span class="newtext">Passive Information Collection and Use</span><br />
               As you navigate around the Site, certain information can be passively collected (that is, gathered
without your actively providing the information), using various technologies. We and our third
party service providers passively collect and use information in a variety of ways, including:

               </p>
                <p>
               <span class="newtext">Through your browser</span><br />
              Certain information is collected by most browsers, such as your
Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen
resolution, operating system version, and Internet browser type and version. We may
collect similar information, such as your device type and identifier, if you access the Site
through a mobile device.

               </p>
                <p>
               <span class="newtext">Using cookies</span><br />
             Cookies are pieces of information stored directly on the computer you
are using. Cookies allow us to collect information such as browser type, time spent on
the Site, pages visited, and language preferences. We and our service providers use the
information for security purposes, to facilitate navigation, display information more
effectively, and to personalize your experience while using the Site. We also use cookies
to recognize your computer or device, which makes your use of the Site easier, such as
to remember what is in your shopping cart. In addition, we use cookies to gather
statistical information about Site usage in order to continually improve its design and
functionality, understand how individuals use it, and to assist us with resolving questions
regarding it. Cookies further allow us to select which of our advertisements or offers are
most likely to appeal to you and display them while you are on the Site. We may also
use cookies in online advertising to track consumer responses to our advertisements.<br /><br />
You can refuse to accept these cookies by following your browser’s instructions;
however, if you do not accept them, you may experience some inconvenience in your use
of the Site. You may also not receive advertising or other offers from us that are relevant
to your interests and needs. To learn more about cookies, please visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org.">http://www.allaboutcookies.org.</a>

                <p>
               <span class="newtext">Using Flash cookies</span><br />
           Our use of Adobe Flash technology (including Flash Local Stored
Objects (“Flash LSOs”)) allows us to, among other things, serve you with more tailored
information, facilitate your ongoing access to and use of the Site, and collect and store
information about your use of the Site. If you do not want Flash LSOs stored on your
computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash LSO storage
using the tools contained in the Website Storage Settings Panel. You can also control
Flash LSOs by going to the Global Storage Settings Panel and following the instructions
(which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash
LSOs (referred to as “information” on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs
from being placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8
and later) how to block Flash LSOs that are not being delivered by the operator of the
page you are on at the time). Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit
acceptance of Flash LSOs may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash
applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection with the Site or
our online content.
