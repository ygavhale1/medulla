              	<h2>Welcome</h2>
                    <p>Welcome to <!--Diabetes Sweet and SimpleWhere Life Starts--> Weight Set Go . This site/page is owned by Johnson & Johnson Limited. This Privacy Policy is designed to tell you about our practices regarding collection, use, and disclosure of information that you may provide via this site/page. Please be sure to read this entire Privacy Policy before using or submitting information to this site/page. This site/page is intended for use by residents of India. </p>
                    <h2>Your Consent</h2>
                    <p>By using this site/page, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. Whenever you submit information via this site/page, you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
                    <h2>About Children </h2>
                    <p>This site/page is not intended for children under the age of 18. We will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information via this site/page from visitors in this age group. We encourage parents to talk to their children about their use of the Internet and the information they disclose to websites and such other social media. </p>
                    <h2>Passive Information Collection </h2>
                    <p>As you navigate through this site/page, certain anonymous information can be passively collected (that is, gathered without your actively providing the information) using various technologies, such as cookies, Internet tags or Web beacons, and navigational data collection (log files, server logs, clickstream). Your Internet browser automatically transmits to this site/page some of this anonymous information, such as the URL of the site/page you just came from and the Internet Protocol (IP) address and the browser version your computer is currently using. This site/page may also collect anonymous information from your computer through cookies and Internet tags or Web beacons. You may set your browser to notify you when a cookie is sent or to refuse cookies altogether, but certain features of this site/page might not work without cookies. </p>
                    <p>This site/page may use and combine such passively collected anonymous information to provide better service to site/page visitors, customize the site/page based on your preferences, compile and analyze statistics and trends, and otherwise administer and improve the site/page for your use. Such information is not combined with personally identifiable information collected elsewhere on the site/page unless you have consented.  More information about cookies and other passive tracking methods discussed above –</p>
                    <div class="smallFonts">
                        <p>A &quot;cookie&quot; is a bit of information that a site/page sends to your Web  browser that helps the site/page remember information about you and your  preferences. </p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Session&rdquo;  cookies are temporary bits of information that are used to improve navigation,  block visitors from providing information where inappropriate (the site/page  &ldquo;remembers&rdquo; previous entries of age or country of origin that were outside the  specified parameters and blocks subsequent changes), and collect aggregate  statistical information on the site/page. They are erased once you exit your  Web browser or otherwise turn off your computer. </p>
                        <p>&quot;Persistent&quot;  cookies are more permanent bits of information that are placed on the hard  drive of your computer and stay there unless you delete the cookie. Persistent  cookies store information on your computer for a number of purposes, such as  retrieving certain information you have previously provided (such as  passwords), helping to determine what areas of the  site/page visitors find most valuable, and  customizing the site/page based on your preferences on an ongoing basis.  Persistent cookies placed by this site/page on your computer may hold  personally identifiable information, but only if you have registered or have  otherwise consented to the retention of personally identifiable information you  have <br />
                          provided  at the site/page. Otherwise, our site/page&rsquo;s server only knows that an  unidentified visitor with your cookie has returned to the site/page. </p>
                        <p>You  can set your browser to accept all cookies, to reject all cookies, or to notify  you whenever a cookie is offered so that you can decide each time whether to  accept it. To learn more about cookies and how to specify your preferences,  please search for &quot;cookie&quot; in the &ldquo;Help&rdquo; portion of your browser. </p>
                        <p>A site/page  may use Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP address is a number assigned to  your computer by your Internet service provider so you can access the Internet  and is generally considered to be non-personally identifiable information,  because in most cases an IP address is dynamic (changing each time you connect  to the Internet), rather than static (unique to a particular user's computer).  The IP address can be used to diagnose problems with a server, report aggregate  information, determine the fastest route for your computer to use in connecting  to a site/page, and administer and improve the site/page. </p>
                        <p>&quot;Internet  tags&quot; (also known as single-pixel GIFs, clear GIFs, invisible GIFs, and  1-by-1 GIFs) are smaller than cookies and tell the  site/page server information such as the IP  address and browser type related to the visitor's computer. Tags may be placed  both on online advertisements that bring people to the site/page and on  different pages of the site/page. Such tags indicate how many times a page is  opened and which information is consulted. </p>
                        <p>&quot;Navigational data&quot; (log files, server  logs, and clickstream data) are used for system management, to improve the  content of the site/page, market research purposes, and to communicate  information to visitors. </p>
                    </div>
                    <h2>Use and Disclosure of Information</h2>
                    <p>Except as otherwise stated, we may use information collected via this site/page to improve the content of our site/page, to customize the site/page to your preferences, to communicate information to you (if you have requested it), for our marketing and research purposes, and for any other purpose specified. In addition, we may make full use of all information acquired through this site/page that is not in personally identifiable form. </p>
                    <h2>Security </h2>
                    <p>This site/page takes reasonable steps to protect personally identifiable information as you transmit it to our site/page and to protect such information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. You should keep in mind that no Internet transmission is ever completely secure or error-free. In particular, e-mail sent to or from this site/page may not be secure. </p>
                    <h2>Links to Other Web Sites </h2>
                    <p>This site/page may contain links or references to other site/pages to which this Privacy Policy does not apply. We encourage you to read the Privacy Policy of every site/page you visit. </p>
